# How do Rad Rabbits age?

Each Rad Rabbit has its own DNA based on the combination of its items, traits and their rarity. Rabbits with the rarest items and traits age at a lower rate, whereas rabbits with more common traits will age more quickly. 

Your Rad Rabbits will age and eventually die. But you can save them! In the Metaverse you can get rare items, win fights, take part in competitions. Your activity affects your Rabbit's lifespan. Achieve IMMORTALITY in the Metaverse!
